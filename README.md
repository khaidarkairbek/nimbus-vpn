## In Progress

Nimbus VPN provides a robust and secure way to establish VPN connections. It is compatible with both macOS and Linux. The project employs the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm for secure key generation and uses the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm for authenticated encryption, ensuring that data remains confidential and tamper-proof.

## Features

- **Secure Key Exchange**: Uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to securely establish shared secret keys between the client and server.
- **Authenticated Encryption**: Implements the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm to encrypt and authenticate data, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity.
- **TUN Device Management**: Handles the creation, configuration, and operation of TUN devices for secure network tunneling.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with macOS and Linux, with platform-specific optimizations.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles system signals for clean and safe shutdown of both client and server applications.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Provides an intuitive command-line interface for easy configuration and management.

### Workflow

1. **Initialization**
   - Parse command-line arguments to determine mode (client or server).
   - Initialize necessary components based on mode.

2. **Server Operations**
   - Bind to the specified address and port.
   - Enable IP forwarding.
   - Set up a TUN device.
   - Enter event loop to handle incoming connections and data.

3. **Client Operations**
   - Bind to the local address and port.
   - Set up a TUN device.
   - Initiate a handshake with the server to establish a secure connection.
   - Configure the default gateway to route traffic through the VPN.
   - Enter event loop to handle data transmission.

4. **Key Exchange and Data Transmission**
   - Perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret key.
   - Encrypt and decrypt messages exchanged between client and server.
   - Transmit data through the established VPN tunnel.

5. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Monitor for `Ctrl-C` signals.
